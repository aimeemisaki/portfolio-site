                    <p className='about-text pt-2'>I was born and raised in Crenshaw of Los Angeles, CA, where I saw poverty and the mistreatment of marginalized communities first-hand. I then went to New York University to study political rights, but specifically in rights of marginalized people in city development. In 2016, during my second year of undergraduate studies, while studying city planning in Paris, I worked in social services. I helped refguees - primarily Syrian refugees finding shelter - with affordable housing and employment. Providing a better quality of life under a very constricted time was my priority.<br/><br/>

                    When I returned to New York after my study and work abroad, I continued this hands-on work helping marginalized communities by facilitating local community hearings; in response to the needs voiced by many parents in the neighborhood, I launched a Saturday Art School program so that my students knew there was a myriad of opportunities for their future. Before each day-class, I brought the group of students together to get feedback (eg. if they wanted a different form of art class, such as dance). I used my own network of art professionals to provide my students with what they deserved from their feedback.
