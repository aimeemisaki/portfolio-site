                    <p className='about-text pt-2'>I was born and raised in Crenshaw of Los Angeles, CA, where I saw poverty and the mistreatment of marginalized communities first-hand. I then went to New York University to study political rights, but specifically the rights of marginalized people in city development. <br/><br/>
                    
                    During my second year of undergraduate studies, I worked in social services in Paris helping refguees - primarily Syrian refugees finding shelter - with affordable housing and employment. Providing a better quality of life under a very constricted timeframe was my priority.<br/><br/>

                    When I returned to New York after my study and work abroad, I continued this hands-on work helping marginalized communities by facilitating local community hearings; in response to the needs voiced by many parents in the neighborhood, I launched a Saturday Art School program so that my students knew there was a myriad of opportunities for their future. Before each class, I brought the group of students together to get feedback. I used my own network of art professionals and anything I could do to provide my students with what they deserved.<br/><br/>

                    <b>While I learned the values of time management, problem-solving and communication from these opportunities, I wanted to get to the systemic causes of these issues.</b><br/><br/>
                    
                    As I re-focused my studies more into urban sustainaible city planning, I worked at an environmental think-tank, where I submitted reports of my analyses of different cities' urban sustainability plans for EU consideration; I expanded the scope of the company's analyses by introducing socio-economic and cultural impacts of these plans on marginalized communities. I also assisted in researching environmental criminal law in Spain with the legal team of the company. <br/><br/>

                    Although I was able to gain comparatmentalization, analytical research and cross-disciplinary skills from this work, I felt there was no room to grow, and more importantly, saw no impact in my work due to the bureaucratic processes of city/municipality/federal laws.<br/><br/>

                    When COVID-19 occurred, I had just graduated and all funds for the city government's environmental sector were all funnelled to pandemic relief; sustainability was out of the picture. Meanwhile, I got into a car accident, where I almost lost my life. 
                    
                    <br/><br/>I began to re-prioritize the things that mattered to me: passions that challenge me, being around nature and financial stability.<br/><br/>

                    So I switched career paths to software engineering, as it involved problem-solving, seeing instant impact of my work, teamwork and a new language and work ethic I could learn and adapt to as I had done in the past. Thus, I enrolled in General Assembly's Fullstack Software Engineering Immersive Program to dive deep into the in-demand languages and softwares of today's tech world. <br/><br/>

                    Since then, I have used my communication and branding skills from working at Parley as an Artist Manager, securing four major art shows around the wolrd, re-configuring old projects to optimize efficiency and now currently work as a Freelance Software Engineer. As an avid figure (mostly Godzilla) collector, I launched my own online Japanese collector toy store this year.  <br/><br/>
                    
                    I'm deeply excited for my future, and if you've made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read about my past and current lives.
